Title: Resources

Various resources/links of interests that I always end up referring to for various reasons. This page is mainly for my own use, but everyone else is welcome to refer to it and propose links to add. Just hit me up on [twitter](https://twitter.com/domothy) or make a PR on github for [this file](https://github.com/domothyb/website/blob/master/content/resources.md)

The ecosystem moves so fast that sometimes you want to look back at a tweet/chart/post you've seen last week and it's nowhere to be found. The goal of this page is to keep track of those neat things.
